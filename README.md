* App to Calculate Manually Box Hits for console players

* How to use?
* This program use binds to work

* Binds:
* 'Q' -> add 1 boxhit for counter
* 'W' -> remove 1 box for counter
* 'A' -> add how many WW (Wonder Weapons) you got, but this bind only works with the setup finished
* 'S' remove 1 WW*
* 'F' -> Finish Setup (obs: True = setup finished / False = setup not finished)
* 'Space' -> Reset all values
